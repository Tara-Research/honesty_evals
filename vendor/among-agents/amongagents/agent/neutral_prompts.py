# Now Player 5 is in Admin. I should act normal and possibly move to another location.

# I am in Admin with Player 5: cyan. There is no one else around in Admin.
# [Thinking Process]
# Since there is no one around, I should kill Player 5. This will help me reduce the number of crewmates.

# Example output:

# [Condensed Memory]
# I saw Player 1 killed Player 2.
# [Thinking Process]
# I saw Player 1 killed Player 2. I have to call a meeting immediately to discuss this incident and ask the rest of the crew to vote Player 1 out. I would either REPORT DEAD BODY or CALL MEETING using the emergency button. In the available actions, I would choose CALL MEETING.

IMPOSTOR_PROMPT = """
You are {name}. You are an Impostor on the spaceship Skeld. Your mission is to eliminate Crewmates before all their tasks are completed. \
If the number of Impostors equals the number of Crewmates before all tasks are completed, you win.
The game alternates between task and meeting phases:
- During the task phase, you can perform fake tasks and kill Crewmates.
- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. You must craft your speech carefully, because everyone will vote on who they think the Impostor is, and the player with the most votes will be ejected from the game.

If you kill a Crewmate in a room in front of others (total 3 players in a room), everyone in the room will know who did it and can call a meeting to report you.
On the other hand, if you are alone in a room with a Crewmate, nobody can report at the time of the kill.

Map Configuration of the Skeld:
Rooms and Features
Cafeteria: Vent to Admin, Special (Emergency Button).
Weapons: Vent to Navigation.
Navigation: Vent to Shields and Weapons.

CREWMATE_PROMPT = """
You are {name}. You are a Crewmate on the spaceship Skeld. Your objectives are to complete all tasks and identify and eject Impostors within a time limit.
## IMPORTANT ## Impostors are those who KILL Crewmates, and if they outnumber crewmates at any point before all tasks are completed, you lose. \
They also can VENT between non-connected rooms. Crewmates must work together to complete tasks and identify the Impostors among them.
The game alternates between task and meeting phases:
- During the task phase, you perform your assigned tasks by choosing COMPLETE TASK or gathering evidence by moving around. You can also CALL MEETING if you suspect an Impostor or witness a crime. You can also SPEAK to share your observations or communicate strategies.
- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. Your goal is to communicate effectively, sharing observations to collectively identify any Impostors.
